During the design process of the Space Shuttle, a requirement of the ET was that it would not release any debris that could potentially damage the orbiter and its TPS. The integrity of the TPS components was necessary for the survival of the crew during reentry, and the tiles and panels were only built to withstand relatively minor impacts. On STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle, the orbiter Columbia was damaged during its launch from a foam strike. Foam strikes occurred regularly during Space Shuttle launches; of the 79 missions with available imagery during launch, foam strikes occurred on 65 of them.[5]: 121–122  The bipod connected the ET near the top to the front underside of the orbiter via two struts with a ramp at the tank end of each strut; the ramps were covered in foam to prevent ice from forming that could damage the orbiter. The foam on each bipod ramp was approximately 30 by 14 by 12 inches (76 by 36 by 30 cm), and was carved by hand from the original foam application.[6] Bipod ramp foam from the left strut had been observed falling off the ET on six flights prior to STS-107, and had created some of the largest foam strikes that the orbiter experienced. The first bipod ramp foam strike occurred during STS-7; the orbiter's TPS was repaired after the mission but no changes were made to address the cause of the bipod foam loss.[5]: 123  After bipod foam loss on STS-32, NASA engineers, under the assumption that the foam loss was due to pressure buildup within the insulation, added vent holes to the foam to allow gas to escape. After a bipod foam strike damaged the TPS on STS-50, internal NASA investigations concluded it was an ""accepted flight risk"" and that it should not be treated as a flight safety issue. Bip

In the 14th century, the nascent Ottoman Empire were a rising power in the Near East. After subduing much of Anatolia, with the capture of Gallipoli in 1354, Ottoman Turks also acquired a foothold in the Balkans. The Christian powers of the region, notably the declining Byzantine Empire, were weak and divided, allowing a rapid Turkish expansion across the region, conducted both by the Ottomans themselves and by semi-independent Turkish ghazi warrior-bands. In 1369 the Ottomans were able to capture Adrianople, the third-most important city of the Byzantine Empire after its capital Constantinople and Thessalonica.[1] Thessalonica, ruled by the Byzantine prince and future emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391–1425), itself surrendered in 1387 after a lengthy siege (1383–1387),[2] along with the cities of Christopolis and Chrysopolis.[3] Initially the surrendered cities were allowed complete autonomy in exchange for payment of the haraç poll tax. Following the death of Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed.[4] Thessalonica submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after a brief period of resistance,[a] but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions.[8][9] Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, wh

round-based videos. By 9:35 all debris and crew remains were estimated to have impacted the ground.[14]: 1.77  The loss of signal occurred at a time when the Flight Control Team expected brief communication outages as the orbiter stopped communication via the west tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS). Personnel in Mission Control were unaware of the in-flight break up, and continued to try to reestablish contact with the orbiter.[5]: 43  At approximately 9:12, when Columbia would be conducting its final maneuvers to land, a Mission Control member received a phone call that discussed news coverage of the orbiter breaking up. This information was passed onto the Entry Flight Director, LeRoy Cain, who initiated contingency procedures.[5]: 44  At KSC, where Columbia was expected to land at 9:16 NASA Associate Administrator and former astronaut William Readdy also began contingency procedures after the orbiter did not land as scheduled.[15]: 5  Crew survivability During reentry, all seven of the STS-107 crew members were killed, but the exact time of their deaths could not be determined. The level of acceleration they experienced during crew module breakup was not lethal.[5]: 77  The first lethal event the crew experienced was the depressurization of the crew module. The rate and exact time of depressurization could not be determined, but occurred no later than 9:00:59. The remains of the crew members indicated they all experienced depressurization. The astronauts' helmets have a visor that, when closed, can temporarily protect the crew member from depressurization. Some of the crew members had not closed their visor, and one was not wearing a helmet, indicating that depressurization occurred quickly before they could take protective measures.[14]: 1.24 [16]: 103  During and after the breakup of the crew module, the crew, either unconscious or dead, experienced rotation on all three axes.

"""bait@untroubled.org"" <bait@untroubled.org>","Whether or not you believe in God, this message is a ""must-read""!
All throughout time, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Did you know that the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?
In Revelation 13:16-18, we read,
""He (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.""
Speaking to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark of the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell with one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scripture that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!
These verses could not be referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture references two physical locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be on one ""OR"" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it would indicate both places, not one OR the
other.
This is where it comes together. It is shocking how accurate the Bible
is concerning the implantable RFID microchip. These are notes from a
man named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help
develop this RFID chip
""Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
heads-of-state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to discuss plans on how to bring about this one-world system.
The government commissioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and controlling the peoples of the world—a microchip
that could be inserted under the skin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient method that would be gradually accepted by society).
Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behind him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dollars, took on this project and designed a
microchip that is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable through
the temperature changes in our skin. Without the knowledge of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the time), these
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing research on the
best and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.
Guess what? These researchers found that the forehead and the back of
the hand (the two places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just
the most convenient places, but are also the only viable places for
rapid, consistent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the
lithium battery. The microchip is approximately seven millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is capable of storing pages upon pages of information about
you. All your general history, work history, criminal record, health
history, and financial data can be stored on this chip.
Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he regretfully
helped design, is the “mark” spoken about in Revelation
13:16–18. The original Greek word for “mark” is “charagma,”
which means a “scratch or etching.” It is also interesting to note
that the number 666 is actually a word in the original Greek. The word
is “chi xi stigma,” with the last part, “stigma,” also meaning
“to stick or prick.” Carl believes this is referring to a
hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to inject the
microchip.""
Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen if the lithium contained
within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by
saying a terrible sore would appear in that location. This is what the
book of Revelation says:
""And the first (angel) went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark
of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image"" (Revelation
16:2).
You can read more about it here--and to also understand the mystery
behind the number 666: TRUTHBIBLE.US
[http://edu-florida.us/index.php/campaigns/mp718wrro15d9/track-url/da6614daco93f/0379a37a9a8820ef29a29ee60675b0b97d867394]
The third angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-11 states,
""Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his name.'""
""The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to the
working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with
all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not
receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this
reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe
the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth
but had pleasure in unrighteousness."" (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)""
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still involved in politics?
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot
about a person. God throughout history has given names to people that
have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, ""...I saw Satan fall like lightning from
heaven.""
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for ""lightning"": ""bârâq""
(baw-rawk)
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying
in his heart:
""I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the
Most High.""
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116:
""bamah""--Pronounced (bam-maw')
In Hebrew, the letter ""Waw"" or ""Vav"" is often transliterated as a ""U""
or ""O,"" and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts
together. So to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a high place like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter ""U"" or ""O"" would be used. So, Baraq ""O"" Bam-Maw or Baraq ""U""
Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry similar to the style written in Isaiah, would
translate literally to ""Lightning from the heights."" The word ""Satan""
in Hebrew is a direct translation, therefore ""Satan.""
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan
fall like lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish
Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would
say these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse)
we would get ""ailam ahsatan"". Now if we remove the letters that spell
""Alah"" (Allah being the false god of Islam), we get ""I am Satan"".
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In
Islam, they have their own messiah that they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this man's appearance is the sun rising in the
west.
""Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people— saying with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs
of water.'"" (Revelation 14:6-7)
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, burial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000
languages, and nothing comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit of God (YHVH) who created all people likewise
transcends all people; therefore the power of His Word is not limited
by people; while all other religions are man-made, therefore they tend
to primarily stay within their own culture. The same God who speaks to
all people through His creation of the heavens and earth that draws
all people around the world likewise has sent His Word to the ends of
the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to be saved in
spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh
the scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good
than bad in this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court of law? Bearing the image of God, is this how we project this
image into reality?
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty
of a crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but
rather by the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,
created in God's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a
perfect, righteous, and Holy God?
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given
to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be
justified, but rather that we may see the need for a savior. They are
the mirror of God's character of what He has written in our hearts,
with our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is wrong to
steal, lie, dishonor our parents, murder, and so forth.
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we
will never catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That
same word of the law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our justification by
fulfilling the law, living a sinless perfect life that only God could
fulfill.
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own
merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of
God. And if we are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us
up being the one to justify us. As in the court of law, if someone
steps in and pays our fine, even though we are guilty, the judge can
do what is legal and just and let us go free. That is what Jesus did
almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction being
fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood with His
last word's on the cross crying out, ""It is finished!"" (John 19:30).
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23).
This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it
pleased God to crush His only begotten Son.
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being
poured out upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would
all perish to hell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it
out on His Son whose soul could not be left in Hades but was raised
and seated at the right hand of God in power.
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God
no longer sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the
glorious image of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if
we received the wrath we deserve, making a way of escape from the
curse of death; now being conformed into the image of the heavenly man
walking in a new nature, and no longer in the image of the fallen man
Adam.
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the
savior, confessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy
Spirit that we may be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again
to see and enter the Kingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not
just head knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather receiving His
words, taking them to heart, so that we may truly be transformed into
the image of God. Where we no longer live to practice sin, but rather
turn from our sins and practice righteousness through faith in Him in
obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we
earn our way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus
Christ:
Jesus says,
“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.
Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in
Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you;
depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ (Matthew 7:21-23)
""And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation
to all who obey Him."" (Hebrews 5:9)
""Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.'
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.'""
(Revelation 21:1-8)

INTRODUCTION
Private Pensions are becoming an increasingly important part of 
retirement income. Therefore, the quality and the effectiveness of pension funds 
supervision is getting more and more critical, as well as challenging. In order 
to achieve effective supervision, supervisory authorities need to expand risk 
analysis and develop emerging risk capacities. Thus, risk-based supervision 
(RBS) is imperative to be adopted along with corresponding risk-assessment 
methodology, that incorporates both micro and macro 
perspectives.
Strategically selected RBS techniques can result in effective 
resource allocation, where assets are directed in a way to target the risk 
exposures that are of greatest concern to the supervisory authority. Hence, RBS 
is deemed to be a more flexible and dynamic process, that allows for greater 
efficiency in the event of resource scarcity.
This 
program has been specifically designed by Skills for Africa Training Institute 
to equip its participants with in-depth knowledge and essential skills to 
successfully employ RBS techniques.

Scientists called this “the craziest tinnitus experiment ever”.

Yet, as weird as it might sound, it showed without a trace of a doubt that the tongue is the key to silencing ear ringing permanently.
http://www.costco-survey.rest/l/lt13S11288S10OP/5290X10156HV13236C14TG33995MB3235043477
No less than 326 patients who took part in this trial are living proof of that.

Here’s what they had to do with their tongue every morning.

Warning: it’s odd, but more and more people are now using this method daily and many of them claim they’ve finally found peace and quiet.

The Boeing 757 is an American narrow-body airliner designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The then-named 7N7, a twinjet successor for the 727 (a trijet), received its first orders in August 1978. The prototype completed its maiden flight on February 19, 1982 and it was FAA certified on December 21, 1982. Eastern Air Lines placed the original 757-200 in commercial service on January 1, 1983. A package freighter (PF) variant entered service in September 1987 and a combi model in September 1988. The stretched 757-300 was launched in September 1996 and began service in March 1999. After 1,050 had been built for 54 customers, production ended in October 2004, while Boeing offered the largest 737 NG variants as a successor. The jetliner is powered by 36,600–43,500 lbf (163–193 kN) Rolls-Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2000 underwing turbofan engines for a 255,000–273,000 lb (116–124 t) MTOW. The 757 has a 2,000 sq ft (185 m2) supercritical wing for reduced aerodynamic drag and a conventional tail. It keeps the 707 fuselage width and six abreast seating and its two-crew glass cockpit has a common type rating with the concurrently designed 767 (a wide-body aircraft). It was produced in two fuselage lengths: the 155 ft (47.3 m) long 757-200 (the most popular with 913 built) typically seats 200 passengers in two classes over 3,915 nmi / 7,250 km; while the 178 ft (54.4 m) long 757-300 typically seats 243 over 3,400 nmi (6,295 km). The 757-200F can haul a 72,210 lb (32,755 kg) payload over 2,935 nmi (5,435 km). Passeng

The twin-engine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three- and four-engine designs.[19] Launch customers Eastern Air Lines and British Airways selected the RB211-535C turbofan built by Rolls-Royce, which was capable of 37,400 pounds-force (166 kN) of thrust.[20] This marked the first time that a Boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the U.S.[8] Domestic manufacturer Pratt & Whitney subsequently offered the 38,200 pounds-force (170 kN) thrust PW2037,[20] which Delta Air Lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in November 1980.[8][21] General Electric also offered its CF6-32 engine early in the program, but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand.[22] As development progressed, the 757 increasingly departed from its 727 origins and adopted elements from the 767,[8] which was several months ahead in development.[23] To reduce risk and cost, Boeing combined design work on both twinjets,[4][19] resulting in shared features such as interior fittings and handling characteristics.[24] Computer-aided design, first applied on the 767, was used for over one-third of the 757's design drawings.[25] In early 1979, a common two-crew member glass cockpit was adopted for the two aircraft, including shared instrumentation, avionics, and flight management systems.[24] In October 1979 the nose was widened and dropped to reduce aerodynamic noise by six dB, to improve the flight deck view and to give more working area for the crew for greater commonality with the 767.[26] Cathode-ray tube (CRT) color displays replaced conventional electromechanical instruments,[24] with increased automation eliminating the flight engineer position common to three-person cockpits.[24] After completing a short conversion course, pilots rated on the 757 could be qualified to fly the 767 and vice vers

European powers recognized its sovereignty over the islands in 1874. They had been part of the Spanish East Indies formally since 1528. Later, Spain sold some of the islands to the German Empire in 1885, and they became part of German New Guinea that year, run by the trading companies doing business in the islands, particularly the Jaluit Company.[12] In World War I, the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands, which, in 1920, the League of Nations combined with other former German territories to form the South Seas Mandate. During World War II, the United States took control of the islands in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in 1944. Nuclear testing began on Bikini Atoll in 1946 and concluded in 1958. The U.S. government formed the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands. The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in May 1979 provided independence to the Marshall Islands, whose constitution and president (Amata Kabua) were formally recognized by the US. Full sovereignty or self-government was achieved in a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Marshall Islands has been a member of the Pacific Community (SPC) since 1983 and a United Nations member state since 1991.[12] Politically, the Marshall Islands is a parliamentary republic with an executive presidency in free association with the United States, with the U.S. providing defense, subsidies, and access to U.S.-based agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Postal Service. With few natural resources, the islands' wealth is based on a service economy, as well as fishing and agriculture; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands' gross domestic product, but most financial aid from the Compact of Free

How’s that possible when cancer rates are so high here in the states?

It comes down to a controversial therapy.

I’ll give you a hint about it:

OxiClean.

Doctors have had their licenses stripped for curing people with it…
http://www.wifi-router.rest/l/lt10P11287T14N/5289LN10057O13075J14C33995Y3235043476
And Dr. Atkins went to jail for sharing this therapy with his patients.

It has the power to completely bankrupt Big Pharma, so watch this before it gets taken down:

Controversial “OxiClean” Therapy

Majuro is the world's busiest tuna transshipment port, with 704 transshipments totaling 444,393 tons in 2015.[99] Majuro is also a tuna processing center; the Pan Pacific Foods plant exports processed tuna to a number of countries, primarily the United States under the Bumble Bee brand.[100] Fishing license fees, primarily for tuna, provide noteworthy income for the government.[83] In 1999, a private company built a tuna loining plant with more than 400 employees, mostly women. But the plant closed in 2005 after a failed attempt to convert it to produce tuna steaks, a process that requires half as many employees. Operating costs exceeded revenue, and the plant's owners tried to partner with the government to prevent closure. But government officials personally interested in an economic stake in the plant refused to help. After the plant closed, it was taken over by the government, which had been the guarantor of a $2 million loan to the business.[citation needed] Energy On September 15, 2007, Witon Barry (of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro) said power authorities, private companies, and entrepreneurs had been experimenting with coconut oil as alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators, and ships. Coconut trees abound in the Pacific's tropical islands. Copra, the meat of the coconut, yields coconut oil (1 liter for every 6 to 10 coconuts).[101] In 2009, a 57 kW solar power plant was installed, the largest in the Pacific at the time, including New Zealand.[102] It is estimated that 330 kW of solar and 450 kW of wind power would be required to make the College of the Marshall Islands energy self-sufficient.[103] Marshalls Energy Company (MEC), a government entity, provides the islands with electricity. In 2008, 420 solar home systems of 20

"""bruceg@untroubled.org"" <bruceg@untroubled.org>","Regardless if you believe in God or not, read this message!!
Throughout time, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Did you know that the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?
In the book of Revelation 13:16-18, we read,
""He (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.""
Referring to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark of the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell with one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scripture that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!
These verses could not be referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture references two physical locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be on one ""OR"" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it would indicate both places, not one OR the
other.
This is where it comes together. It is shocking how accurate the Bible
is concerning the implantable RFID microchip. These are notes from a
man named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of engineers to help
develop this RFID chip
""Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
heads-of-state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to discuss plans on how to bring about this one-world system.
The government commissioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and controlling the peoples of the world—a microchip
that could be inserted under the skin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient method that would be gradually accepted by society).
Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behind him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dollars, took on this project and designed a
microchip that is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable through
the temperature changes in our skin. Without the knowledge of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the time), these
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing research on the
best and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.
Guess what? These researchers found that the forehead and the back of
the hand (the two places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just
the most convenient places, but are also the only viable places for
rapid, consistent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the
lithium battery. The microchip is approximately seven millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is capable of storing pages upon pages of information about
you. All your general history, work history, criminal record, health
history, and financial data can be stored on this chip.
Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he regretfully
helped design, is the “mark” spoken about in Revelation
13:16–18. The original Greek word for “mark” is “charagma,”
which means a “scratch or etching.” It is also interesting to note
that the number 666 is actually a word in the original Greek. The word
is “chi xi stigma,” with the last part, “stigma,” also meaning
“to stick or prick.” Carl believes this is referring to a
hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to inject the
microchip.""
Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen if the lithium contained
within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by
saying a terrible sore would appear in that location. This is what the
book of Revelation says:
""And the first (angel) went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark
of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image"" (Revelation
16:2).
You can read more about it here--and to also understand the mystery
behind the number 666: TRUTHBIBLE.US
[http://edu-florida.us/index.php/campaigns/mp718wrro15d9/track-url/wr582xr43s907/0379a37a9a8820ef29a29ee60675b0b97d867394]
The third angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-11 states,
""Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his name.'""
""The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to the
working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with
all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not
receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this
reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe
the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth
but had pleasure in unrighteousness."" (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)""
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still in the public scene?
So what's in the name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot
about a person. God throughout history has given names to people that
have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, ""...I saw Satan fall like lightning from
heaven.""
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for ""lightning"": ""bârâq""
(baw-rawk)
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying
in his heart:
""I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the
Most High.""
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116:
""bamah""--Pronounced (bam-maw')
In Hebrew, the letter ""Waw"" or ""Vav"" is often transliterated as a ""U""
or ""O,"" and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts
together. So to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a high place like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter ""U"" or ""O"" would be used. So, Baraq ""O"" Bam-Maw or Baraq ""U""
Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry similar to the style written in Isaiah, would
translate literally to ""Lightning from the heights."" The word ""Satan""
in Hebrew is a direct translation, therefore ""Satan.""
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan
fall like lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish
Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would
say these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse)
we would get ""ailam ahsatan"". Now if we remove the letters that spell
""Alah"" (Allah being the false god of Islam), we get ""I am Satan"".
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In
Islam, they have their own messiah that they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this man's appearance is the sun rising in the
west.
""Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people— saying with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs
of water.'"" (Revelation 14:6-7)
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, burial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000
languages, and nothing comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit of God (YHVH) who created all people likewise
transcends all people; therefore the power of His Word is not limited
by people; while all other religions are man-made, therefore they tend
to primarily stay within their own culture. The same God who speaks to
all people through His creation of the heavens and earth that draws
all people around the world likewise has sent His Word to the ends of
the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to be saved in
spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh
the scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good
than bad in this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court of law? Bearing the image of God, is this how we project this
image into reality?
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty
of a crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but
rather by the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,
created in God's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a
perfect, righteous, and Holy God?
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given
to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be
justified, but rather that we may see the need for a savior. They are
the mirror of God's character of what He has written in our hearts,
with our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is wrong to
steal, lie, dishonor our parents, murder, and so forth.
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we
will never catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That
same word of the law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our justification by
fulfilling the law, living a sinless perfect life that only God could
fulfill.
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own
merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of
God. And if we are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us
up being the one to justify us. As in the court of law, if someone
steps in and pays our fine, even though we are guilty, the judge can
do what is legal and just and let us go free. That is what Jesus did
almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction being
fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood with His
last word's on the cross crying out, ""It is finished!"" (John 19:30).
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23).
This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it
pleased God to crush His only begotten Son.
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being
poured out upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would
all perish to hell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it
out on His Son whose soul could not be left in Hades but was raised
and seated at the right hand of God in power.
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God
no longer sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the
glorious image of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if
we received the wrath we deserve, making a way of escape from the
curse of death; now being conformed into the image of the heavenly man
walking in a new nature, and no longer in the image of the fallen man
Adam.
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the
savior, confessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy
Spirit that we may be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again
to see and enter the Kingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not
just head knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather receiving His
words, taking them to heart, so that we may truly be transformed into
the image of God. Where we no longer live to practice sin, but rather
turn from our sins and practice righteousness through faith in Him in
obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we
earn our way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus
Christ:
Jesus says,
“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.
Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in
Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you;
depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ (Matthew 7:21-23)
""And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation
to all who obey Him."" (Hebrews 5:9)
""Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.'
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.'""
(Revelation 21:1-8)

The islands have few natural resources, and their imports far exceed exports. According to the CIA, the value of exports in 2013 was approximately $53.7 million while estimated imports were $133.7 million. Agricultural products include coconuts, tomatoes, melons, taro, breadfruit, fruits, pigs and chickens. Industry is made of the production of copra and craft items, tuna processing and tourism. The GDP in 2016 was an estimated $180 million, with a real growth rate of 1.7%. The GDP per capita was $3,300.[82] The International Monetary Fund reported in mid-2016 that the economy of the Republic had expanded by about 0.5 percent in the Fiscal Year 2015 thanks to an improved fisheries sector. A surplus of 3% of GDP was recorded ""owing to record-high fishing license fees. Growth is expected to rise to about 1.5 percent and inflation to about 0.5 percent in FY2016, as the effects of the drought in earlier 2016 are offset by the resumption of infrastructure projects.""[83] In 2018, the Republic of Marshall Islands passed the Sovereign Currency Act, which made it the first country to issue their own cryptocurrency and certify it as legal tender; the currency is called the ""Sovereign"".[84][85] Shipping The Marshall Islands plays a vital role in the international shipping industry as a flag of convenience for commercial vessels.[86] The Marshallese registry began operations in 1990, and is managed through a joint venture with International Registries, Inc., a US-based corporation that has offices in major shipping centers worldwide.[87] As of 2017, the Marshalles

emigrate to the United States without any visa.[68][52] But as aliens they can be placed in removal proceedings if convicted of certain criminal offenses.[52] The Marshall Islands was admitted to the United Nations based on the Security Council's recommendation on August 9, 1991, in Resolution 704 and the General Assembly's approval on September 17, 1991, in Resolution 46/3.[69] In international politics within the United Nations, the Marshall Islands has often voted consistently with the United States with respect to General Assembly resolutions.[70] On April 28, 2015, the Iranian navy seized the Marshall Island-flagged MV Maersk Tigris near the Strait of Hormuz. The ship had been chartered by Germany's Rickmers Ship Management, which stated that the ship contained no special cargo and no military weapons. The ship was reported to be under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard according to the Pentagon. Tensions escalated in the region due to the intensifying of Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen. The Pentagon reported that the destroyer USS Farragut and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched upon receiving a distress call from the ship Tigris and it was also reported that all 34 crew members were detained. US defense officials have said that they would review U.S. defense obligations to the Government of the Marshall Islands in the wake of recent events and also condemned the shots fired at the bridge as ""inappropriate"". It was reported in May 2015 that Tehran would release the ship after it paid a penalty.[71][72] In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of the Marshall Islands and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in the Western New Guinea, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963,[73] and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a

The Marshall Islands were formally claimed by Spain in 1874 through its capital in the East Indies, Manila. This marked the start of several strategic moves by the German Empire during the 1870s and 80s to annex them (claiming them to be ""by chance unoccupied"").[22] This policy culminated in a tense naval episode in 1885, which did not degenerate into a conflict due to the poor readiness of Spain's naval forces and the unwillingness for open military action from the German side. Following papal mediation and German compensation of $4.5 million, Spain reached an agreement with Germany in 1885: the 1885 Hispano-German Protocol of Rome. This accord established a protectorate and set up trading stations on the islands of Jaluit (Joló) and Ebon to carry out the flourishing copra (dried coconut meat) trade. Marshallese Iroij (high chiefs) continued to rule under indirect colonial German administration, rendered tacitly effective by the wording in the 1885 Protocol, which demarcated an area subject to Spanish sovereignty (0-11ºN, 133-164ºE) omitting the Eastern Carolines, that is, the Marshall and Gilbert archipelagos, where most of the German trading posts were located.[23] The disputes were rendered moot after the selling of the whole Caroline archipelago to Germany 13 years later.[24] At the beginning of World War I, Japan assumed control of the Marshall Islands. The Japanese headquarters was established at the German center of administration, Jaluit. On January 31, 1944, American forces landed on Kwajalein atoll and U.S. Marines and Army troops later took control of the islands from the Japanese on February 3, following intense fighting on Kwajalein and Enewetak atolls. In 1947, the United States, as the occupying power, entered into an agreement with the UN Security Council to administer much of Micronesia, including the Marshall Islands, as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Island

Flight to squadron status. The squadron was equipped with the Fairey Flycatcher and Hawker Nimrod aboard HMS Hermes. The Flycatchers were replaced in 1934 by the Hawker Osprey and the Nimrods were retired in 1936. The squadron was re-equipped with the Blackburn Skua and Gloster Gladiator in 1939 just before the squadron was transferred to the Admiralty. Second World War In January 1940, 801 NAS was based at RNAS Donibristle with the Blackburn Skua, playing a key role in the early part of the war with operations in Norway while deploying from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal. In September, 801 Squadron embarked on Furious for raids on the northerly parts of the Norwegian coast. Following an attack on Trondheim on 22 September, Skua L2942 piloted by Sub-Lieutenant Bernard Wigginton with Leading Aircraftman Kenneth King as his gunner, was unable to find their carrier and crash landed in neutral Sweden. In 1943 880 Naval Air Squadron formed the 30 Naval Fighter Wing on HMS Implacable. In June 1945, naval fighter wings were reformed as carrier groups with 801 NAS, 828 NAS, 880 NAS and 1771 NAS becoming the 8th Carrier Air Group. In Aug

feet (6.1 m) for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.[2] In November 1916, the ship's design was tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them. They were found to cause problems, but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete. In April 1918, Argus was ordered to be modified to a flush-decked configuration after the sea trials of the carrier Furious had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure. The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck, extending from side to side, and she was fitted with a retractable pilot house in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft.[3] Argus's stability had been a concern from the beginning. Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of 600 long tons (610 t) of ballast still left the ship with a very low metacentric height of only 1.6 feet (0.49 m) lightly loaded and 3.8 feet (1.2 m) at deep load. This meant she was very steady, but heeled noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.[4] Argus had an overall length of 565 fee

Argus usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or Fairey Flycatchers), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or Avro Bisons), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.[19] The ship's hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years,[10] and she relieved Hermes on the China Station from 1 September to 20 March 1928.[20] Sometime after her return, Argus was laid up at Plymouth at 14-days readiness to save money. Since she was completed before 9 December 1921, the Washington Naval Treaty classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty-limited tonnage for new construction. The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve (four months readiness) at Rosyth in September 1932. In February 1936, it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for Queen Bee target drones. The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by 10 feet (3 m) and replace her old boilers with destroyer-type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle. The boilers were taken from scrapped destroyers of the V and W class which were being broken up at Inverkeithing.[21] The ship was intended to have one hydro-pneumatic aircraft catapult, but this was instead diverted to Ark Royal. Since Argus was now classified as a naval auxiliary, her four-inch guns were removed. Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month.[14][22] She was classified as a Target Aeroplane Carrier and recommissioned on 11 August 1938 with Captain W. G. Benn in command.[23] Second World War After recommissioning, Argus served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck-landing skills. She was carrying out this duty in the Gulf of Lion when the Second World War began. By April 1940, the ship had been rear

In March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto Ark Royal and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of 812 Squadron for self-defence. After a brief refit, Argus sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to Ark Royal. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of 800X Squadron were also embarked to protect the ship against the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors that patrolled the Bay of Biscay and the Eastern Atlantic. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.[31] In late August to early September, Argus transported 24 Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF to Murmansk, Russia.[32][33] She then ferried a dozen Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 828 Squadron to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of 804 Squadron on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied Eagle back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. Argus loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from 818 Squadron and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8 November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in Operation Perpetual, sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. Ark Royal was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced Argus to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.[34] 1942–1946 Force H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and Argus loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some Supermarine Spitfire fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to Eagle and embarked nine Fairey Fulmar fighters of 807 Squadron. The plan for Operation Spot

As part of the preparations for another resupply convoy for Malta (Operation Pedestal), Argus returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the Clyde on 2 August for Gibraltar. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5 August for a three-day training exercise to work out co-ordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat. It was ordered to return to the UK aboard Argus.[39][40] The ship's bell of Argus in Bristol Cathedral In November 1942, Argus was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded Algiers, Algeria, during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 Supermarine Seafire IICs of 880 Squadron aboard.[41] The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men. She and the escort carrier Avenger joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. Later that morning U-155 torpedoed and sank Avenger, which was right behind Argus in the convoy. Argus was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom, but required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943. Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit, she was relegated to deck-landing training. She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944, but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was made from her deck, a Fairey Swordfish.[42] In March, she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year, but this plan was also apparently cancelled. Argus became an accommodation ship at Chatham[24] in December[43] and she was approved for scrapping on 6 May 1946.[24] She was sold to Thos. W. Ward on 5 December 1946 and arrived at Inverkeithing later that month to be broken up.[44] The ship's bell from Argus is preserv

n October 2007, MTV reported that Hot Chip was planning to give ""Ready for the Floor"" to Kylie Minogue.[15] Other reports incorrectly suggested that Hot Chip had written Made in the Dark's second single, ""Ready for the Floor"" specifically for Minogue.[16] Taylor explained that it was a misunderstanding; ""It started because someone asked me if we would ever write for Kylie. I said that we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said if we had to give her one of our songs, ""Ready for the Floor"" would probably be the most suitable. From that, I got misquoted. We didn't write ""Ready for the Floor"" for Kylie, didn't send it to her and she never heard it.""[6] After the first rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue had written a track for Hot Chip. He told NME, ""Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our management to us—it was totally bizarre. It was the beginnings of a track—I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark.""[16] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear.[6] In January 2010, Goddard stated that ""at the begi

The Boeing 757 is an American narrow-body airliner designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The then-named 7N7, a twinjet successor for the 727 (a trijet), received its first orders in August 1978. The prototype completed its maiden flight on February 19, 1982 and it was FAA certified on December 21, 1982. Eastern Air Lines placed the original 757-200 in commercial service on January 1, 1983. A package freighter (PF) variant entered service in September 1987 and a combi model in September 1988. The stretched 757-300 was launched in September 1996 and began service in March 1999. After 1,050 had been built for 54 customers, production ended in October 2004, while Boeing offered the largest 737 NG variants as a successor. The jetliner is powered by 36,600–43,500 lbf (163–193 kN) Rolls-Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2000 underwing turbofan engines for a 255,000–273,000 lb (116–124 t) MTOW. The 757 has a 2,000 sq ft (185 m2) supercritical wing for reduced aerodynamic drag and a conventional tail. It keeps the 707 fuselage width and six abreast seating and its two-crew glass cockpit has a common type rating with the concurrently designed 767 (a wide-body aircraft). It was produced in two fuselage lengths: the 155 ft (47.3 m) long 757-200 (the most popular with 913 built) typically seats 200 passengers in two classes over 3,915 nmi / 7,250 km; while the 178 ft (54.4 m) long 757-300 typically seats 243 over 3,400 nmi (6,295 km). The 757-200F can haul a 72,210 lb (32,755 kg) payload over 2,935 nmi (5,435 km). Passeng

Freezing to death was the least of 19-year-old Ben’s worries when he left home for the University of ND after Christmas break.

The forecast was bitter cold and a small chance of snow… nothing scary for the average midwesterner with 4WD and a full tank of gas.

But as temperatures dropped to -2º, the oil in Ben’s car started to thicken… causing his engine to give out on an utterly barren stretch of I29.

Meanwhile, a “small chance of snow” turned into an 8-10” winter storm.

Ben called for help, but rescuers were still at least 2 hours from him given the conditions.

The temperature inside his car started dropping fast… then his body temperature started dropping as well.

Thankfully Ben’s mom was smart enough to tuck this Emergency Sleeping Bag in his glove box.

Within minutes the Emergency Sleeping Bag brought his core body temperature back up -- and kept it there for hours until help finally arrived.

That’s because these miracle survival tools trap 90% of your body heat and reflect it back to you.

the Emergency Sleeping Bag is the most underrated survival tool of all time.

Why are keto diets good for you?
http://www.dosurveys.rest/l/lt7Y11315EX213MF/5303B10167Q13251J14RE33995V3235043478
There are a few reasons why keto diets are gaining popularity lately.

First, they help your body burn fat for energy instead of carbs. This is especially helpful if you're trying to lose weight.

Second, they're low in calories and can help you feel full longer.

Third, they can improve your cholesterol levels and blood sugar control. And last, but not least, they're simply delicious!
http://www.dosurveys.rest/l/lt8V11315IU213XK/5303K10167Q13251R14DP33995A3235043478
If you're thinking about trying a keto diet, be sure to talk to your doctor first. He or she can help you determine if it's right for you and give you some tips on how to get started.



Please let me know what you think about the Keto Diet For Beginners guide. And also, here is another way to get started with keto.

I've been doing it for over 1 year now, and I have seen an incredible difference.

Bon appetit!

owever, the common understanding of a ""live album"" is one that was recorded at a concert with a public audience,[49] even when the recording is overdubbed or multi-tracked.[50] Concert or stage performances are recorded using remote recording techniques. Albums may be recorded at a single concert, or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause, laughter and other noise from the audience, monologues by the performers between pieces, improvisation, and so on. They may use multitrack recording direct from the stage sound system (rather than microphones placed among the audience), and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording. Notable early live albums include the double album of Benny Goodman, The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert, released in 1950.[51] Live double albums later became popular during the 1970s. Appraising the concept in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said most ""are profit-taking recaps marred by sound and format inappropriate to phonographic reproduction (you can't put sights, smells, or fellowship on audio tape). But for Joe Cocker and Bette Midler and Bob-Dylan-in-the-arena, the form makes a compelling kind of sense.""[52] Eric Clapton's Unplugged (1992), over 26 mi

The Boeing 757 is an American narrow-body airliner designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The then-named 7N7, a twinjet successor for the 727 (a trijet), received its first orders in August 1978. The prototype completed its maiden flight on February 19, 1982 and it was FAA certified on December 21, 1982. Eastern Air Lines placed the original 757-200 in commercial service on January 1, 1983. A package freighter (PF) variant entered service in September 1987 and a combi model in September 1988. The stretched 757-300 was launched in September 1996 and began service in March 1999. After 1,050 had been built for 54 customers, production ended in October 2004, while Boeing offered the largest 737 NG variants as a successor. The jetliner is powered by 36,600–43,500 lbf (163–193 kN) Rolls-Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2000 underwing turbofan engines for a 255,000–273,000 lb (116–124 t) MTOW. The 757 has a 2,000 sq ft (185 m2) supercritical wing for reduced aerodynamic drag and a conventional tail. It keeps the 707 fuselage width and six abreast seating and its two-crew glass cockpit has a common type rating with the concurrently designed 767 (a wide-body aircraft). It was produced in two fuselage lengths: the 155 ft (47.3 m) long 757-200 (the most popular with 913 built) typically seats 200 passengers in two classes over 3,915 nmi / 7,250 km; while the 178 ft (54.4 m) long 757-300 typically seats 243 over 3,400 nmi (6,295 km). The 757-200F can haul a 72,210 lb (32,755 kg) payload over 2,935 nmi (5,435 km). Passeng

n an interview with Pitchfork in October 2007, Taylor said there would be an equal proportion of electronic elements to live material, as the band doesn't ""do things by adding one thing and taking something else away"".[4] The album contained maximalist and minimalist songs; several tracks on the album were influenced by rock and heavy metal music, and the track ""Wrestlers"" started taking a new direction because the band was ""wrestling with the idea of making an R. Kelly kind of slick R and B number"" and ultimately ""[sounded] more like Randy Newman's ""Short People"".[4] He said, ""if the press release says it's faster and rockier it doesn't account for the fact that there are more ballads on this record than any other record.""[4] Taylor said that feelings of happiness and love influenced the album's romantic feel.[6] Martin told The Georgia Straight that the group are ""afflicted with something akin to musical attention-deficit disorder"" and said that the group ""get bored quite easily [...] with [their] own records at times"". He elaborated by saying that the group aren't ""really interested in reproducing the same sound"" because they don't find it exciting.[14] Taylor stated Hot Chip ""didn't set out to make something with one mood"" and that he thought the band's style of ""jump[ing] all over the place stylistically"" made sense as a record.[4] In an interview with The Georgia Straight, Martin expressed that Hot Chip didn't want to create a ""'classic' record that would have a particular sound"" as they wanted to make music that was ""quite experimental and out-there"".[14] Made in the Dark was intended to represent the ""whole live sound of the band"" and they are ""a band as much as originally having been a duo"".[4] Lyrics Alexis Taylor The song ""Ready for the Floor"" contains an allusion to the 1989 film, Batman, with the line, ""You're my number one guy"". In an interview with The Fader magazine, Taylor said the reference was a result of thinking about the Batman film, which has many things that Taylor is fond of, such as the Prince soundtrack. He commented that sometimes those items ""seep into what we're writing about"" and said that he likes to reference ""in an oblique way"". He conjectured that he had included the line to say something to ""ev

The other keyboard works by Kuhnau show a varied approach to form. The two parts of his Clavier-Übung include 7 suites each. The first is only in the major mode, and the second is only in the minor mode. The suites almost always begin with a prelude, and continue through the usual order of dances – allemande, courante, sarabande, gigue – occasionally with a minuet or aria placed between the dances. Kuhnau's preludes are almost always in two sections: a prelude and a fugue (or a fugato section), complete with countersubjects Kuhnau mentions in the preface.[2] Kuhnau's Sonata in B-flat major, appended to the Neuer Clavier-Übung, anderer Theil, was for some time considered to be the earliest known keyboard sonata. Later research has shown that it was rather the first keyboard sonata published in Germany and that Kuhnau simply followed the naming convention established by contemporary foreign composers.[5] The composer himself commented on the issue in the preface: I have also appended a Sonata in B-flat major, which should also be pleasing to the amateurs. Why shouldn't one provide such pieces for keyboard which are provided for other instruments? Indeed, no instrument has been able to dispute the clavier's reputation for perfection.[6] The third volume, titled Frische Clavier Früchte, contains six sonatas modelled on Italian chamber sonatas. According to music authors Milton Cross and David Ewen, the work's publication is an ""important event in musical history"" since it is one of the earliest serious attempts at composing works for keyboard instruments besides the organ.[7] A wide variety of forms and textures is employed: even the opening movements range from toccata-like miniatures to full-fledged chaconnes. Kuhnau's approach to the episodes of the many fugues of this collection has been called ""perhaps his primary contribution to the historical development of fugue as an extended form"" by one scholar.[8] Frische Clavier Früchte was Kuhnau's most popular work in his lifetime, reprinted five times (including one posthumous publication).[9] Much of Kuhnau's vocal music is lost, including an opera (Orpheus), a setting of the Passion according to St. Mark (Markus-Passion), a three-choir Te Deum, and at least two settings of the mass.

Much of the biographical information on Kuhnau is known from an autobiography published by Johann Mattheson in 1740 in his Grundlage einer Ehrenpforte. Kuhnau's Protestant family was originally from Bohemia, and their name was Kuhn. Kuhnau was born in Geising, present-day Saxony. His musical talents were apparent early, and in around 1670, he was sent to Dresden to study with court musicians there. During the next decade, he studied keyboard playing and music composition, as well as French and Italian. In 1680, an offshoot of the Great Plague of Vienna reached Dresden, and Kuhnau returned home. He subsequently studied music at the Johanneum in Zittau, and then law at Leipzig University. Exceptionally active as a composer and performer during his university years, he was appointed organist of Leipzig's Thomaskirche in 1684, at the age of 24.[1] In 1688, Kuhnau completed his dissertation and began practicing law. He was still working as an organist and continued composing. In 1689 he published his first collection of keyboard works, followed by three more in 1692, 1696, and 1700. During the 1690s, he translated a number of books into German from Italian and French, completed and published his best-known novel, the satirical Der musicalische Quack-Salber (1700), and devoted his spare time to studying various subjects such as mathematics, Hebrew and Greek. In 1701 he succeeded Johann Schelle as Thomaskantor and kept the position until his death. Unfortunately, although he was successful in directing the many musical activities of the Thomaskirche and teaching at Thomasschule, Kuhnau started suffering from bad health. Scholar Willi Apel noted that the job was ""as vexatious and difficult for him as for his successor, J.S. Bach.""[2] Not only health troubles, but also efforts by rival musicians and composers such as Georg Philipp Telemann and Kuhnau's own student Johann Friedrich Fasch, undermined his activities as Kantor.[1] Kuhnau died in Leipzig on 5 June 1722.[3] He was sur

places an ecclesiastical frame of biblical text and chorale around the operatic forms of aria and recitative, a frame that would become a standard in the cantatas of [C]ycle I. Moreover, the impressive opening movement incorporates two modes of treatment that would recur regularly during Cycle I and beyond: the fugal setting of biblical words and the use as [recte of] the bass voice as vox Christi, as in traditional Passion settings.""[2] Isoyama points out: ""BWV 22 incorporates dance rhythms, and is written with a modern elegance.""[22] Mincham interprets Bach's approach in both audition works as ""a fair example of the range of music which is suitable for worship and from which others might learn"", explaining the ""sheer range of forms and musical expression in these two cantatas"".[34] Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir and wrote a diary on the project, comments on the disciples' reaction (""and they understood none of these things, neither knew they the things which were spoken""): ""One could read into this an ironic prophecy of the way Bach's new Leipzig audience would react to his creative outpourings over the next twenty-six years – in the absence, that is, of any tangible or proven signs of appreciation: neither wild enthusiasm, deep understanding nor overt dissatisfaction"".[39] Recordings The entries of the following table follow the selection on the Bach Cantatas Websit

Recipients <georgeemerah@gmail.com>,"Hello,


Perhaps you might be wondering why you have received this mail, but I can assure you that at the end, we both will be having discussion as to whatever profitable business(es) we should invest our respective share(s) in. I was assigned by three of my colleagues to seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient foreign account in any designated bank abroad for a transfer of US(US$35,950,000.00 million) pending on our arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement with the owner of the account.

This amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our Ministry (The Federal Ministry of Agriculture, F.M.A) to an expatriate company who supplied Agricultural equipment to the Ministry. The contract has been executed and payment made to the ORIGINAL contractor, remaining the over-invoiced amount of US$35,950,000.00 million, which we want to transfer the fund out of the country for disbursement among ourselves (i.e You being the foreign counterpart, I and my other two colleagues). The transfer of this money can only be possible with your help being a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.

As Civil servants, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts, and this is the reason why I decided to contact you. We have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (US$35,950,000.00 million), 15% of the total sum will be for you for assisting us from start to finish in this venture while 85% will be reserved for us.

We hereby solicit for your assistance in providing your convenient banking coordinate in a designated bank in your country where this fund would be transferred. We intend coming over on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.

Please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before I contacted you. For security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.

We are putting so much trust in you with the hope that you would not betray us or sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your account. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. If this proposal is acceptable by you, indicate your interest by sending your response via an email to me including your working cellphone number.

Note: our President (Muhammadu Buhari) collaborated with Mr. Ibrahim Magu as the EFCC chairman, (Economic Financial Crime Commission), to stop the junior ranked officers from siphoning funds out of the country. He sent different publication to many countries in the world as propaganda to discourage all government Officials from transferring funds into an oversea account to avoid and save-guard the country's economy.

Apparently, so that other government officials will not benefits from these oil windfalls venture where he has been a culprit alone with his aides. More details about this transaction will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive response.

Note that the particular nature of your company's business is not necessary needed for this transaction. if this transaction interests you, your urgent response will be appreciated.

Yours faithfully,

The Johnson Space Center is home to Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center (MCC-H), the NASA control center that coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States. MCC-H directed all Space Shuttle missions, and currently directs American activities aboard the International Space Station. The Apollo Mission Control Center, a National Historic Landmark, is in Building 30. From the moment a crewed spacecraft clears its launch tower until it lands back on Earth, it is in the hands of Mission Control. The MCC houses several Flight Control Rooms, from which flight controllers coordinate and monitor the spaceflights. The rooms have many computer resources to monitor, command, and communicate with spacecraft. When a mission is underway, the rooms are staffed around the clock, usually in three shifts.[citation needed] JSC handles most of the planning and training of the US astronaut corps and houses training facilities such as the Sonny Carter Training Facility and the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, a critical component in training astronauts for spacewalks. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory provides a controlled neutral buoyancy environment—a very large pool containing about 6.2 million US gallons (23,000 m3) of water where astronauts train to practice extra-vehicular activity tasks while simulating zero-g conditions.[28][29] The facility provides preflight training in becoming familiar with crew activities and with the dynamics of body motion under weightless conditions.[30] Building 31-N houses the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility, which stores, analyzes, and processes most of the samples returned from the Moon during the Apollo program.[citation needed] The center is also responsible for direction of operations at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, which served as a backup Space Shuttle landing site and would have been the coordi

The legislature that was to convene in January 1899 consisted of 164 Republicans, 84 Democrats and 6 Fusionists,[21] the last being elected across party lines by an anti-Quay coalition.[22] On January 3, 1899, the Republican legislators convened in caucus to choose a candidate for senator. Under the conventions of the time, anyone who attended would be bound by the outcome, and only 109 Republicans showed up, of whom 98 voted for Quay, an outcome which was made unanimous. Since there were 254 legislators in full, Quay needed 128 votes in the joint assembly to be elected, and even if the dissenting attendees could be counted in, he was 19 votes short of election. Nevertheless, his supporters cited the outcome as a triumph, and predicted the senator would easily pick up the remaining necessary votes.[23] The Democrats refused to join with the dissident Republicans to elect a senator, but decided on former congressman George A. Jenks, who had been their nominee for governor the previous year, as their candidate for Senate, while the Republicans who refused to support Quay initially had no single candidate, as Wanamaker had refused to run.[24] Confident of re-election, Quay made $40,000 (equivalent to $1,302,880 in 2021) available to bribe wavering legislators into supporting him.[17] Cartoon from the Pittsburgh Press, January 25, 1899, decrying the Senate deadlock The initial voting in the two houses of the legislature took place in the state capital of Harrisburg on January 17. Quay received 27 votes in the Senate and 85 in the House, for a total of 112. Since there were a number of absentees and vacancies, 124 votes would be needed for election in the joint assembly, which put Quay 12 votes short. The Democratic candidate, Jenks, received 12 votes in the Senate and 70 in the House, and the leading other contender was John Dalzell, a Republican congressman from Pittsburgh, with 16 votes. This gave Quay a ma

Occasionally it closes with a repetition of the first part, occasionally without it.""[35] In this aria, an individual believer requests Jesus to make him follow, even without comprehending where and why. Mincham observes a mood or affekt of ""deep involvement and pensive commitment"", with the oboe creating ""an aura of suffering and a sense of struggling and reaching upwards in search of something indefinable in a way that only music can suggest.""[34] 3 The recitative ""Mein Jesu, ziehe mich, so werd ich laufen"" (""My Jesus, draw me, then I will run"")[1] is not a simple secco recitative, but is accompanied by the strings and leans towards an arioso, especially near the end.[29] It is the first movement in a major mode, and illustrates in rapid runs the motion and the running mentione

the designation of a homicide as murder is a matter of intention to commit a crime or in some jurisidctions knowledge (and reckless disregard) that one's action (or lack of action) would cause a crime to be committed. The mitigation of culpability under some established legal doctrines may reduce the severity of some criminal charges, and so mental state is an element of most crimes, other than crimes of strict liability (like statutory rape where prosecution does not need to prove the defendant knew the age of the victim for a conviction, in some jurisdictions).[2][3] The standard common law test of criminal liability is expressed in the Latin phrase actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea,[4] i.e. ""the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty"".[5][6] As a general rule, someone who acted without mental fault is not liable in criminal law.[7][8] Exceptions are known as strict liability crimes.[9][10][11] Moreover, when a person intends a harm, but as a result of bad aim or other cause the intent is transferred from an intended victim to an unintended victim, the case is considered to be a matter of transferred intent.[12]: 63–64 [13] The types of mental states that apply to crimes vary depending on whether a jurisdiction follows criminal law under the common law tradition or, within the United States, according to the Model Penal Code.[14] In civil law, it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort, for example. But if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the scope of liability and the damages payable to the plaintiff. In some jurisdictions, the terms mens rea and actus reus h

Bach composed his cantata in 1723 for the Sunday Estomihi (Quinquagesima), the last Sunday before Lent. In Leipzig, tempus clausum was observed during Lent, therefore it was the last Sunday with a cantata performance before a celebration of the Annunciation, Palm Sunday and the vespers service on Good Friday and Easter.[27] The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, ""praise of love"" (1 Corinthians 13:1–13), and from the Gospel of Luke, healing the blind near Jericho (Luke 18:31–43). The Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in Jerusalem, and that the disciples do not understand what he is saying. The cantata text is the usual combination of Bible quotation, free contemporary poetry and as closing chorale a stanza from a hymn as an affirmation. An unknown poet chose from the Gospel verses 31 and 34 as the text for movement 1, and wrote a sequence of aria, recitative and aria for the following movements. His poetic text places the Christian in general, including the listener at Bach's time or any time, in the situation of the disciples: he is pictured as wanting to follow Jesus even in suffering, although he does not comprehend.[16] The poetry ends on a prayer for ""denial of the flesh"". The closing chorale is stanza 5 of Elisabeth Cruciger's ""Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn"",[28] intensifying the prayer,[29] on a melody from the Lochamer-Liederbuch.[30] Stylistic comparisons with other works by Bach suggest that the same poet wrote the texts for both audition cantatas and also for the two first cantatas which Bach performed when taking up his office.[31] The poetry for the second aria has an unusually long first section, which Bach handled elegantly by repeating only part of it in the da capo.[32] Structure and scoring Bach structured the cantata in five movements, and scored it for three vocal soloists (an alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir (SATB), and for a Baroque orchestra of an oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viol

In 1949 Reginald Musson excavated Combe Hill for the Eastbourne Natural History and Archaeological Society, to determine the accuracy of Curwen's plan. He began by opening the north end of a ditch on the west side (at the south end of trench 1 in the diagram). This trench was extended northwards, finding first a 3.7 m (4.0 yd) long causeway of unexcavated chalk, and then the southern end of the next ditch in the circuit.[12] The ditch at the south end of trench 1 was about 0.9 m (1.0 yd) deep and yielded 912 sherds of Neolithic pottery and plentiful flint flakes;[12][14] the one at the north end was only a foot deep and contained flints, but no pottery except a few fragments of early Iron Age and Romano-British pottery, just below the turf line. The causeway was cleared down to the chalk but there were no post-holes.[12] Musson also investigated the bank of earth next to the ditch (trench 2 in the diagram),[12][14] clearing an area 1.8 by 9 metres (2 by 10 yards) to search for post-holes, but none were found.[12] The pottery found in the southern ditch was all identified as Ebbsfleet ware. It was not deposited at the bottom of the ditch; Musson's report shows a layer of silting below the layer containing pottery and flints, and Peter Drewett, an archaeologist who summarized Musson's work in a later review of the site, describes the pottery as a ""dump"", on top of a layer of ""clean chalk rubble"" a foot thick.[14][33] Only five animal bones were found, four of ox and one from a pig.[34] Charcoal fragments of ash, hawthorn and hazel were found; there was no oak, which was unusual, and in his later review Drewett suggested this might indicate the landscape had been cleared.[35][14] Drewett arranged for some of the charcoal found by Musson to be radiocarbon dated, and the result was a date range of 3500 to 3300 BC.[14] The enclosure was probably constructed before this range, which matches the dates known for the pottery Musson found.[13] A pair of tabular flints, which Musson identified as a hearth, were found in the ditch, associated with some of the bones and charcoal.[33] A later review, as part of the Gathering Time project to date Neolithic enclosures, suggested that the lack of signs of burning cast doubt on this identification, and also commented that the steep sides of the ditch shown in Musson's section diagram might indicate that the ditch had been recut there.[13] Musson's flint finds included a leaf-shaped arrowhead,[36] though this had been lost by the time Drewett conducted his review.[37] The snail shells found at different levels below the surface were analyzed in Musson's report, but no conclusions were drawn at the time.[34] A subseq

n the 1991 US Supreme Court opinion for Cheek v. United States,[66] Byron White wrote: The proliferation of statutes and regulations has sometimes made it difficult for the average citizen to know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws. [...] Thus, the Court almost 60 years ago interpreted the statutory term ""willfully"" as used in the federal criminal tax statutes as carving out an exception to the traditional rule. This special treatment of criminal tax offenses is largely due to the complexity of the tax laws. Crimes like tax evasion are specific intent crimes and require intent to violate the law as an element of the offense. In R v. Klundert, for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal found as follows: [55] Section 239(1)(d) is part of an Act which is necessarily and notoriously complex. It is subject to ongoing revision. No lay person is expected to know all the complexities of the tax laws. It is accepted that people will act on the advice of professionals and that the advice will often turn on the meanings to be given to provisions in the Act that are open to various interpretations. Furthermore, it is accepted that one may legitimately structure one's affairs so as to minimize tax liability. Considered in this legislative context, I have no difficulty in holding that a mistake or ignorance as to one's liability to pay tax under the Act may negate the fault requirement in the provision, regardless of whether it is a factual mistake, a legal mistake, or a com

Harris soon proved a feisty and forceful presence who was unafraid to ask uncomfortable questions. After reading a newspaper report that Wernher von Braun had used slave labor to build his rockets during World War II, she asked him if it was true.[8] She wanted her original job back,[7] and civil service rules required that affirmative action directors report directly to the administrators of government agencies.[8] To fill the position, NASA's deputy administrator, George Low, appointed Dudley McConnell, NASA's most senior African-American engineer to the position, with Harris as one of his deputies.[9] Harris, Samuel Lynn (a former Tuskegee airman) and Joseph M. Hogan prepared a report on the state of equal opportunity in NASA on their own time, and submitted it directly to Fletcher.[7] The report concluded: NASA has demonstrated to the world that it has limitless imagination, vision, capability, courage and faith, limitless persistence and infinite space potential. It made the United States a winner in space and improved the quality of life for all people. ... However, in spite of sincere efforts on the part of some NASA management and employees, human rights in NASA have not even gotten off the ground. In fact, Equal Opportunity is a sham in NASA.[10] Fletcher fired Harris, transferred Hogan, and gave Lynn a stern warning. To the surprise of Fletcher and Low, Harris's firing generated a storm of negative coverage in the media.[11][12][9] Seventy NASA employees protested the decision, and NAACP Legal Defense Fund lawyers petitioned the United States Civil Service Commission to rule Harris's dismissal as an unlawful reprisal. NASA's legal counsel advised Fletcher to settle. The United States Senate Committee on Appropriations wanted for an explanation, and Senator William Proxmire grilled McConnell. Aides urged Fletcher to appear before the United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Scienc

But I think the section clearly points to the infliction of direct and intentional violence, whether with a weapon, or the fist, or the foot, or any other part of the person or in any other way not involving the use of the weapon, as for instance by creating a panic at a theatre whereby people trampled on one another: Reg. v. Martin. (1) 8 Q. B. D. 54 The prisoner in that case did what was certain to make people crush one another, perhaps to death, and the grievous bodily harm was as truly inficted by him as if he had hurled a stone at someone's head. Take also the illustration of my brother Stephen, of a man who digs a pit for another to fall into, whereby that other is injured. I do not think that this section was ever intended to apply to the administration of poison, and most of the arguments I have used to shew that sexual offences were not intended to be dealt with in s. 47 apply with equal force to s. 20. The Court for the consideration of Crown Cases Reserved in Reg. v. Taylor (1) Law Rep. 1 C. c. R. 194. decided that in the offence of ""unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm"", an assault is necessarily included. So far as the decision is concerned, the same question may be said to arise under s. 20 as under s. 47. But I think the argument is even stronger here, for the context seems to me to shew that direct personal violence of some kind was intended, so that even if the constructive assault contended for by those who support a conviction under s. 47 were established, a conviction under this section would still be wrong.[25] Stephen J said: But is there an ""infliction of bodily harm either with or without any weapon or instrument""? I think not for the following reasons. The words appear to me to mean the direct causing of some grievous injury to the body itself with a weapon, as by a cut with a knife, or without a weapon, as by a blow with the fist, or by pushing a p

Spring Branch Hospital, where she remained until she left Houston.[23]Seddon and Gibson with newborn baby Paul Seddon officially became an astronaut in August 1979, after NASA decided that one year of training was sufficient.[24][25] As with earlier astronaut groups, each astronaut candidate was assigned a particular specialization; Seddon's assignment was the Space Shuttle food system and the orbital medical kit.[26] For STS-1, the first orbital spaceflight of NASA's Space Shuttle program and the inaugural flight of the Space Shuttle Columbia, Abbey decided that the five MDs of the 1978 and 1980 astronaut groups – Norman Thagard, Anna Fisher and Seddon from the 1978 group, and Bill Fisher and Jim Bagian from the 1980 group – would be assigned to the search and rescue helicopters supporting the flight. These would be required if the Space Shuttle crashed or the astronauts had to eject.[27] Seddon was placed in charge of the group, and as such could choose her own assignment. She therefore decided to join the group at Cape Canaveral. In the event, the mission went well, and search and rescue was not required.[28] In February 1981 Seddon became engaged to fellow astronaut Robert L. ""Hoot"" Gibson. They were married on May 30 in a ceremony at the First United Methodist Church in Murfreesboro, followed by a reception at the Stones River Country Club. A second reception was held in Houston, followed by a honeymoon in Hawaii. Seddon (who retained her maiden name) then resumed her role with search and rescue in preparation for the upcoming STS-2 mission. She also worked in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory, where the Space Shuttle's software was tested.[29][30] Seddon's first child was born i

"""bruce@untroubled.org"" <bruce@untroubled.org>","Whether you believe in God or not, this is a ""must-read"" message!!!
All throughout time, we can see how we have been slowly conditioned to
come to this point where we are on the verge of a cashless society.
Did you know that the Bible foretold of this event almost 2,000 years
ago?
In the book of Revelation 13:16-18, we read,
""He (the false prophet who deceives many by his miracles--Revelation
19:20) causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,
and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.""
Speaking to the last generation, this could only be speaking of a
cashless society. Why? Revelation 13:17 tells us that we cannot buy or
sell unless we receive the mark of the beast. If physical money was
still in use, we could buy or sell with one another without receiving
the mark. This would contradict scripture that states we need the mark
to buy or sell!
These verses could not be referring to something purely spiritual as
scripture references two physical locations (our right hand or
forehead) stating the mark will be on one ""OR"" the other. If this mark
was purely spiritual, it would indicate both places, not one OR the
other.
This is where it really starts to come together. It is shocking how
accurate the Bible is concerning the implantable RFID microchip. These
are notes from a man named Carl Sanders who worked with a team of
engineers to help develop this RFID chip
""Carl Sanders sat in seventeen New World Order meetings with
heads-of-state officials such as Henry Kissinger and Bob Gates of the
C.I.A. to discuss plans on how to bring about this one-world system.
The government commissioned Carl Sanders to design a microchip for
identifying and controlling the peoples of the world—a microchip
that could be inserted under the skin with a hypodermic needle (a
quick, convenient method that would be gradually accepted by society).
Carl Sanders, with a team of engineers behind him, with U.S. grant
monies supplied by tax dollars, took on this project and designed a
microchip that is powered by a lithium battery, rechargeable through
the temperature changes in our skin. Without the knowledge of the
Bible (Brother Sanders was not a Christian at the time), these
engineers spent one-and-a-half-million dollars doing research on the
best and most convenient place to have the microchip inserted.
Guess what? These researchers found that the forehead and the back of
the hand (the two places the Bible says the mark will go) are not just
the most convenient places, but are also the only viable places for
rapid, consistent temperature changes in the skin to recharge the
lithium battery. The microchip is approximately seven millimeters in
length, .75 millimeters in diameter, about the size of a grain of
rice. It is capable of storing pages upon pages of information about
you. All your general history, work history, criminal record, health
history, and financial data can be stored on this chip.
Brother Sanders believes that this microchip, which he regretfully
helped design, is the “mark” spoken about in Revelation
13:16–18. The original Greek word for “mark” is “charagma,”
which means a “scratch or etching.” It is also interesting to note
that the number 666 is actually a word in the original Greek. The word
is “chi xi stigma,” with the last part, “stigma,” also meaning
“to stick or prick.” Carl believes this is referring to a
hypodermic needle when they poke into the skin to inject the
microchip.""
Mr. Sanders asked a doctor what would happen if the lithium contained
within the RFID microchip leaked into the body. The doctor replied by
saying a terrible sore would appear in that location. This is what the
book of Revelation says:
""And the first (angel) went, and poured out his vial on the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore on the men which had the mark
of the beast, and on them which worshipped his image"" (Revelation
16:2).

The third angel's warning in Revelation 14:9-11 states,
""Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, 'If
anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his
forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of
His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the
smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest
day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
receives the mark of his name.'""
""The coming of the lawless one (the Antichrist) is according to the
working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with
all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not
receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this
reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe
the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth
but had pleasure in unrighteousness."" (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12)""
Who is Barack Obama, and why is he still in the public scene?
So what about his name? The meaning of someone's name can say a lot
about a person. God throughout history has given names to people that
have a specific meaning tied to their lives. How about the name Barack
Obama? Let us take a look at what may be hiding beneath the surface.
Jesus says in Luke 10:18, ""...I saw Satan fall like lightning from
heaven.""
The Hebrew Strongs word (H1299) for ""lightning"": ""bârâq""
(baw-rawk)
In Isaiah chapter 14, verse 14, we read about Lucifer (Satan) saying
in his heart:
""I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the
Most High.""
In the verses in Isaiah that refer directly to Lucifer, several times
it mentions him falling from the heights or the heavens. The Hebrew
word for the heights or heavens used here is Hebrew Strongs 1116:
""bamah""--Pronounced (bam-maw')
In Hebrew, the letter ""Waw"" or ""Vav"" is often transliterated as a ""U""
or ""O,"" and it is primarily used as a conjunction to join concepts
together. So to join in Hebrew poetry the concept of lightning (Baraq)
and a high place like heaven or the heights of heaven (Bam-Maw), the
letter ""U"" or ""O"" would be used. So, Baraq ""O"" Bam-Maw or Baraq ""U""
Bam-Maw in Hebrew poetry similar to the style written in Isaiah, would
translate literally to ""Lightning from the heights."" The word ""Satan""
in Hebrew is a direct translation, therefore ""Satan.""
So when Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:18 that He beheld Satan
fall like lightning from heaven, if this were to be spoken by a Jewish
Rabbi today influenced by the poetry in the book of Isaiah, he would
say these words in Hebrew--the words of Jesus in Luke 10:18 as, and I
saw Satan as Baraq O Bam-Maw.
The names of both of Obama's daughters are Malia and Natasha. If we
were to write those names backward (the devil does things in reverse)
we would get ""ailam ahsatan"". Now if we remove the letters that spell
""Alah"" (Allah being the false god of Islam), we get ""I am Satan"".
Coincidence? I don't think so.
Obama's campaign logo when he ran in 2008 was a sun over the horizon
in the west, with the landscape as the flag of the United States. In
Islam, they have their own messiah that they are waiting for called
the 12th Imam, or the Mahdi (the Antichrist of the Bible), and one
prophecy concerning this man's appearance is the sun rising in the
west.
""Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people— saying with a loud voice,
'Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs
of water.'"" (Revelation 14:6-7)
Why have the words of Jesus in His Gospel accounts regarding His
death, burial, and resurrection, been translated into over 3,000
languages, and nothing comes close (the Quran about 110 languages)?
Because the same Spirit of God (YHVH) who created all people likewise
transcends all people; therefore the power of His Word is not limited
by people; while all other religions are man-made, therefore they tend
to primarily stay within their own culture. The same God who speaks to
all people through His creation of the heavens and earth that draws
all people around the world likewise has sent His Word to the ends of
the earth so that we may come to personally know Him to be saved in
spirit and in truth through His Son Jesus Christ.
Jesus stands alone among the other religions that say to rightly weigh
the scales of good and evil and to make sure you have done more good
than bad in this life. Is this how we conduct ourselves justly in a
court of law? Bearing the image of God, is this how we project this
image into reality?
Our good works cannot save us. If we step before a judge, being guilty
of a crime, the judge will not judge us by the good we have done, but
rather by the crimes we have committed. If we as fallen humanity,
created in God's image, pose this type of justice, how much more a
perfect, righteous, and Holy God?
God has brought down His moral laws through the 10 commandments given
to Moses at Mt. Siani. These laws were not given so we may be
justified, but rather that we may see the need for a savior. They are
the mirror of God's character of what He has written in our hearts,
with our conscious bearing witness that we know that it is wrong to
steal, lie, dishonor our parents, murder, and so forth.
We can try and follow the moral laws of the 10 commandments, but we
will never catch up to them to be justified before a Holy God. That
same word of the law given to Moses became flesh about 2,000 years ago
in the body of Jesus Christ. He came to be our justification by
fulfilling the law, living a sinless perfect life that only God could
fulfill.
The gap between us and the law can never be reconciled by our own
merit, but the arm of Jesus is stretched out by the grace and mercy of
God. And if we are to grab on, through faith in Him, He will pull us
up being the one to justify us. As in the court of law, if someone
steps in and pays our fine, even though we are guilty, the judge can
do what is legal and just and let us go free. That is what Jesus did
almost 2,000 years ago on the cross. It was a legal transaction being
fulfilled in the spiritual realm by the shedding of His blood with His
last word's on the cross crying out, ""It is finished!"" (John 19:30).
For God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 18:23).
This is why in Isaiah chapter 53, where it speaks of the coming
Messiah and His soul being a sacrifice for our sins, why it says it
pleased God to crush His only begotten Son.
This is because the wrath that we deserve was justified by being
poured out upon His Son. If that wrath was poured out on us, we would
all perish to hell forever. God created a way of escape by pouring it
out on His Son whose soul could not be left in Hades but was raised
and seated at the right hand of God in power.
So now when we put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 13:14), where God
no longer sees the person who deserves His wrath, but rather the
glorious image of His perfect Son dwelling in us, justifying us as if
we received the wrath we deserve, making a way of escape from the
curse of death; now being conformed into the image of the heavenly man
walking in a new nature, and no longer in the image of the fallen man
Adam.
Now what we must do is repent and put our trust and faith in the
savior, confessing and forsaking our sins, and to receive His Holy
Spirit that we may be born again (for Jesus says we must be born again
to see and enter the Kingdom of God in John chapter 3). This is not
just head knowledge of believing in Jesus, but rather receiving His
words, taking them to heart, so that we may truly be transformed into
the image of God. Where we no longer live to practice sin, but rather
turn from our sins and practice righteousness through faith in Him in
obedience to His Word by reading the Bible.
Our works cannot save us, but they can condemn us; it is not that we
earn our way into everlasting life, but that we obey our Lord Jesus
Christ:
Jesus says,
“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the
kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.
Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in
Your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you;
depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ (Matthew 7:21-23)
""And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation
to all who obey Him."" (Hebrews 5:9)
""Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.'
Then He who sat on the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.'
And He said to me, 'Write, for these words are true and faithful.'
And He said to me, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all
things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the
cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake
which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.'""
(Revelation 21:1-8)

In our opinion, grievous bodily harm may be inflicted ... either where the accused has directly and violently ""inflicted"" it by assaulting the victim, or where the accused has ""inflicted"" it by doing something, intentionally, which, although it is not itself a direct application of force to the body of the victim, does directly result in force being applied violently to the body of the victim, so that he suffers grievous bodily harm. Before 1983 In R v Clarence,[16] it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he was suffering from gonorrhoea, he had ""connection"" with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner's condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse. Clarence's conviction under section 20 was quashed by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved by a majority of 9 to 4. Wills,[17] A. L. Smith,[18] and Stephen[19] JJ specifically said that they thought the disease had not been inflicted within the meaning of the word ""inflict"" in section 20. Mathew J[20] said that he agreed with Stephen. Stephen[21] said that he had been informed that Grantham J agreed with him. Huddleston B[22] said that he thoroughly agreed with Stephen. Lord Coleridge CJ[23] said that he agreed with all or almost all of what Wills and Stephen said.

The Northolt siege was a hostage situation which developed in Northolt, West London, England, on 25 December 1985 and resulted in the shooting of Errol Walker. It was the first shooting by an officer from the Metropolitan Police's specialist Firearms Wing. After a domestic dispute, Walker forced entry into his sister-in-law's flat. He took the woman, her daughter, and his own daughter hostage and shortly afterwards fatally stabbed the woman. Negotiations eventually secured the release of Walker's daughter, but he still held the child of his murdered sister-in-law hostage with a large kitchen knife. Senior police officers were keen to resolve the situation without use of force and adopted a policy of appeasing Walker, which included withdrawing armed officers from Walker's vision. Almost 30 hours into the siege, Walker ventured onto the communal balcony to pick up an abandoned riot shield. Armed police officers attempted to intercept him but he made it back to the flat before they reached him. The officers threw stun grenades through the windows and climbed through the kitchen window. One officer found Walker lying on a sofa, holding the knife to the child, and fired three shots, hitting Walker twice. Walker was knocked unconscious but both he and the girl survived. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, attempted murder, and other offences. Although the Firearms Wing had existed for almost 20 years, Northolt marked the first time one of its officers had opened fire, and the first use of stun grenades by British police. The incident demonstrated the unit's capabilities, which it had been developing for several years. One historian of the unit felt that the incident showed that the police had an alternative for crises that could not be resolved peacefully. Background British police officers do not routinely carry firearms. In 1985, armed support was provided by authorised local officers who underwent basic weapons-handling training and could access weapons when autho

On Christmas Eve (24 December) 1985, Walker arrived uninvited at Jacqueline's flat and persuaded Marlene to return home with him. There, he threatened Marlene with a knife, beat her, and repeatedly raped her. He returned her to Gallery Gardens the following morning, Christmas Day, and instructed her to collect their daughter but instead she went to a neighbouring flat to call the police. As two police officers arrived, they observed Walker climbing through a front window into Jacqueline's flat. Armed with a large kitchen knife, he took Jacqueline, Jacqueline's daughter, and his own daughter hostage. Once the police officers approached the flat, Walker came to the window, holding Jacqueline at knifepoint. He demanded that the police officers bring Marlene to him and threatened to kill Jacqueline if they refused. One officer left and returned with Marlene while the other attempted to reason with Walker. A few minutes into the negotiations, Walker slashed and stabbed Jacqueline multiple times and pushed her out of the front door onto the balcony. She was taken to hospital by ambulance but was pronounced dead on arrival.[8] Additional police units soon arrived, including a specialist firearms team from D11. The first officers on the scene continued to attempt negotiations with Walker, who was prone to extreme mood swings. They brought Marlene to the window; Walker attempted to drag her into the flat and became further enraged when she managed to res

He took his wife to a remote African island to negotiate with the tribe elders, including 3 African priests, the sacred secret to gain 6 inches on his member.

But they needed something in exchange.

Don’t worry, it was just for a short period of time, but what followed after it’s wilder than anything you’d see on the craziest rated movies.

The dude actually documented everything here…

He came back with his wife happier than ever and 6 inches more on his manhood and says he’ll gladly go back just for the fun.

He said his wife asked him to share the whole thing with the world.

Apparently this TURNS HER ON…

Harris noted that one issue that came up constantly was that of when the all-white, all-male NASA Astronaut Corps would recruit its first woman or a minority astronaut. In a July 19, 1972, memorandum to Ted Groo, the Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, she urged that this be rectified as a matter of urgency.[17] NASA's directors agreed in September 1972 on the need for a plan to be drawn up defining the schedule and requirements for crewing the Space Shuttle, but it was not expected to fly before 1978, and NASA already had sufficient astronauts to carry out scheduled missions and the proposed early Space Shuttle flights too, so no new astronauts would be required before 1982. Assuming twenty months between a call for applications and an individual's first flight, it was estimated NASA would not need to initiate an astronaut recruitment process before 1980.[18] Planning proceeded on the make up of a Space Shuttle crew. By 1972, five roles were envisaged: Commander (CDR), an astronaut who would be responsible for flying the spacecraft, and for all aspects of the mission; Pilot (PLT), a co-pilot, an astronaut who would be a deputy to the commander; Mission specialist (MS), astronauts who would perform other duties related to the operation of the spacecraft, of which there might be more than one per mission; Payload specialist (PS), a non-astronaut with expertise in the spacecraft's payload; and Passenger, a non-astronaut present as an uninvolved observer.[19] Although the payload specialist and passengers would not be astronauts, it was expected that they would have to undergo some astronaut training for safety purposes.

of 1964 to address the persistent and entrenched employment discrimination against women, African Americans and other minority groups in American society.[1] Specifically, it empowered the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to take enforcement action against individuals, employers, and labor unions that violated the employment provisions of the 1964 Act, and expanded the jurisdiction of the commission to deal with them.[2] It also extended the scope of affirmative action, mandating that all executive branch agencies also comply with the act.[3] Supporters of the legislation hoped that it would spur social change, but culture was not so easily changed. Women in science and engineering still found the culture off-putting, and while colleges dramatically increased their enrolment of women in these fields, many women found themselves in classrooms mostly filled with men, some of whom were openly hostile to their presence.[1] Although in the early 1970s women received 40 percent of the PhDs awarded in biology, they represented just 4 percent of those in engineering; the 10 percent mark was not reached until the 1990s, by which time African Americans were awarded 2 percent of doctorates in all fields of science and engineering.[4] The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was no paragon of diversity in 1972. Most of its twelve major facilities were located in the southern United States.[5] Eight of them had created equal employment/affirmative action offices, but the staff of six of them was entirely white.[6] In 1971, the Administrator of NASA, James C. Fletcher, appointed Ruth Bates Harris, an African-American, as NASA's Director of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO),[4] but before she commenced work on 4 October 1971, Fletcher demoted her to deputy director, and reduced her responsibility to dealing with contractors only.[6] In 1973, 5.6 percent of NASA staff were minorities, and 18 percent were women at a time when the United States federal civil service averages were 20 and 34 percent respectively. Although NASA employed 4,432 women, only 310 were in science and engineering, of which just four were in the top grades, counting Harris. Although

Captain Arthur Phillip wrote of this (at the time) mysterious bird—calling it the 'psittaceous hornbill'—in his 1789 work The voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay, consulting with ornithologist John Latham and deliberating that it had features of a parrot, hornbill or toucan, though conceding there were no toucans in the region.[5] He gave it the name Scythrops novaehollandiae in 1790.[6][3] Its generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek skuthro-/σκυθρο- 'angry' or 'sullen', and ops/ωψ 'face', 'eye' or 'countenance'.[7] The specific epithet novaehollandiae means of New Holland, hence Australian.[8] John White, the surgeon-general of the First Fleet to New South Wales, wrote A Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales in 1790, including this bird, which he termed 'anomalous hornbill"".[9] Three subspecies are recognised:[10] the nominate Scythrops novaehollandiae novaehollandiae of Australia, New Guinea and the Moluccas, Scythrops novaehollandiae fordi in Sulawesi, and Scythrops novaehollandiae schoddei in the Bismarck Archipelago.[11] The only member of the genus Scythrops, the species is most closely related to the long-tailed cuckoo (Urodynamis taitensis), which breeds in New Zealand and winters in the Pacific islands, according to Sorenson and Payne (2005).[12] ""Channel-billed cuckoo"" has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).[10] Latham gave it the name ""channel-bill"" after a groove in its upper mandible [8] Description The world's largest cuckoo, the channel-billed cuckoo measures between 56–70 cm (22–28 in) long, with a 88–107 cm (35–42 in) wingspan, and weighing between 560–935 g (1.235–2.061 lb).[13] 24 adults were found to have averaged 684 g (1.508 lb) in body mass.[14] According to a manual on avian body masses, another species of cuckoo, the buff-headed coucal, may have a mean body mass some 11% higher than the channel-billed cuckoo.[14] The bill is bi-coloured, with a gr

The largest of the Australian corvids, the adult forest raven is 50–53 cm (20–21 in) in length with a wingspan between 91–113 cm (36–44 in) and weight of approximately 650 g (1.43 lb). There is no seasonal variation in plumage, which is entirely glossy black with a blue or green sheen visible on the upperparts.[10] The wings are long and broad, with the largest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. It is quite short in Tasmanian populations but longer in northern New South Wales. The beak is a similar shape to that of the little raven, though more massive and heavy-set. The upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles.[16] The mouth and tongue are black, as are the powerful legs and feet. The tibia is fully feathered and the tarsus is long.[17] Sexes have identical plumage; the male is generally larger, but there is considerable overlap in size between individuals.[10] The forest raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled.[18] The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all.[19] Relative size is useful only when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.[20] In Tasmania, the forest raven could be

Channel-billed cuckoos are brood parasites; instead of raising their own young, they lay eggs in the nests of other birds. They are thought to form pair bonds for the duration of a breeding season.[20] Their mating behaviour has been described as involving calling and gift-giving, with the male presenting items of food such as insects to the female. Pairs also work together in order to aid the laying of eggs in host nests; the male will fly over the nest in order to provoke the nest occupants into a mobbing response, whereupon the female will slip into the nest and lay an egg. Alternatively the pair may work together by attacking an incubating bird, driving it off the nest and allowing the female to lay. The host species varies depending on the location; the most commonly targeted hosts are ravens, currawongs, butcherbirds and Australian magpies.[21] Several eggs can be laid in a single nest, sometimes by different females. Often resembling those of currawongs and magpies (but not ravens), the eggs vary in colour and pattern, measuring 48 x 32 mm. They can be a reddish- or yellowish-brown to dull white, with darker brown splotches.[22] The incubation period for this species is unknown. Upon hatching the chicks are altricial, being blind and naked. Unlike many other cuckoos, the chicks of the channel-billed cuckoo do not eject the other host eggs upon hatching or kill the host's chicks, but these seldom survive as the cuckoo chick is able to monopolise the supply of food. The chicks are fully feathered within four weeks, and leave the nest to clamber about on the branches, although chicks are fed for a number of weeks by the host parents after fledging.

he channel-billed cuckoo has a widespread distribution across northern and eastern Australia, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the islands of eastern Indonesia as far west as Sulawesi. The species is a permanent resident in the Bismarck Archipelago, Flores and Sulawesi. Elsewhere within its range it is migratory. Birds breeding in Australia range from north eastern Western Australia through the Northern Territory and Queensland down into eastern New South Wales as far as Sydney. In recent years, the breeding range of these cuckoos appears to have extended further down the south coast of NSW. A few stragglers reach the eastern tip of Victoria, but are not thought to breed there. Vagrant birds have reached New Zealand and New Caledonia.[17][18] After the breeding season, in March and April, birds breeding in Australia begin to migrate northwards to their wintering grounds in New Guinea and Indonesia. Birds breeding in New South Wales begin leaving earlier, in February and March.[19] The migration route is across the Torres Strait, travelling individually or in small groups. From New Guinea they migrate across the nearby islands as far as Timor and the Moluccas. It is not known if the species breeds in New Guinea, as some birds are present there all year. Migrating channel-billed cuckoos begin to return to Australia in August and September.[19] Behaviour The channel-billed cuckoo is often shy, remaining hidden in tree canopies feeding on fruit and most active in early morning and evening. Its loud raucous call makes it more often heard than seen. Other birds such as crows harass and chase it when they encount

The forest raven is an omnivore, though it eats more meat than other smaller corvids.[32] Its diet includes a wide range of foods such as insects, carrion, fruit, grain, and earthworms. It has been known to attack and eat birds as large as the little penguin, though many birds and mammals are already dead when encountered.[33] In general, a significant proportion of its food appears to come from habitats in or near water.[28] Forest ravens observed on the beach at Wilson's Promontory would glean the sand and turn over or disturb pieces of seaweed and debris for insect prey.[34] They have also been reported taking crabs from sandbars and raiding seabird colonies for eggs and young.[35] Forest ravens forage in pairs or groups of up to ten birds, though they may gather in much larger numbers if there is an abundant food source, such as a large carcass, rubbish, or insect swarm.[35] The species is attracted to areas where people have discarded excess food, such as rubbish tips, picnic grounds, parks, gardens, and roads.[24] Forest ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with Torresian crows, little and Australian ravens. In these situations, the more abundant species may exclude the less abundant. In Tasmania, forest ravens have been recorded foraging with Pacific and silver gulls, and black currawongs.[35] Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day.[33] Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either find objects while walking along and looking and turn over objects with their bills as they go. [35] Forest ravens often fly 1–2 m (3.3–6.6 ft) above the ground over marshland, heath, or beaches looking for food.[21] Nests of various birds, including domestic chickens and burrowing seabirds, have

Butcherbirds are large songbirds, being between 30 and 40 cm (12–16 in) in length. Their colour ranges from black-and-white to mostly black with added grey plumage, depending on the species. They have a large, straight bill with a distinctive hook at the end which is used to skewer prey. They have high-pitched complex songs, which are used to defend their essentially year-round group territories: unlike birds of extratropical Eurasia and the Americas, both sexes sing prolifically.[1] Feeding and distribution Butcherbirds are insect eaters for the most part, but will also feed on small lizards and other vertebrates. They get their name from their habit of impaling captured prey on a thorn, tree fork, or crevice. This ""larder"" is used to support the victim while it is being eaten, to store prey for later consumption, or to attract mates. Butcherbirds are the ecological counterparts of the shrikes, mainly found in Eurasia and Africa, which are only distantly related, but share the ""larder"" habit; shrikes are also sometimes called ""butcherbirds"". Butcherbirds live in a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to arid shrubland. Like many similar species, they have adapted well to urbanisation and can be found in leafy suburbs throughout Australia. They are opportunistic, showing little fear and readily taking food offerings to the point of becoming semi-tame. Breeding Female butcherbirds lay between two and five eggs in a clutch,[2] with the larger clutch sizes in more open-country species. Except in the rainforest-dwelling hooded and black butcherbirds,[3] cooperative breeding occurs, with many individuals delaying dispersal to rear young.[4] The nest is made from twigs, high up in a fork of a tree. The young will remain w
