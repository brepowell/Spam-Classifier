<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">There are a number of benefits to choosing a professional alcohol treatment program over attempting an at-home detox and recovery. Each one contributes to the ability of the patient to not only stop drinking but also to stay sober for the long term.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Medical Stabilization<br />When one stops drinking after a time of heavy drinking, he will often experience withdrawal symptoms. In some cases, these withdrawal symptoms are made more difficult by underlying physical or mental health disorders. Serious and life-threatening acute symptoms can develop that require immediate medical attention. A professional alcohol treatment program will be able to provide this initial stabilization as well as ongoing medical monitoring to ensure that the patient is safe at all times.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Safety<br />Medical emergency care, medication regulation and changes, and treatment for psychiatric issues - all these can be provided by a professional alcohol treatment program. Patients are protected in the event of emergency, and they are given the care and support they need to protect against unexpected health events as much as possible.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Relapse Prevention<br />Relapse is a common concern among patients in recovery. Not only can it mean a dangerous accident or drinking so much that it triggers medical or mental health problems, but it can also cause overdose as well. Drinking too much, especially in combination with other substances, or at a time when the body is vulnerable due to detox can translate into a heightened risk for potentially fatal issues.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Therapeutic Intervention<br />Professional alcohol rehab programs offer more than just medical care and assistance; they provide therapeutic support that helps to guide the patient through treatment and prepare him for sobriety out in the real world. Group therapy, personal therapy, alternative therapies, and holistic treatments can all work together to ensure that each patient has the unique set of tools necessary to be successful without drinking.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Peer Support<br />Other residents at an alcohol treatment program can also provide a unique level of support. Hearing the stories of others, learning from their mistakes and their successes, and having someone to talk to when times get rough are all benefits of professional treatment.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Family Support<br />Family members of an addicted person in recovery will benefit from the support of a professional alcohol treatment program. They will learn what to do - and what not to do - to be a solid support system to their loved one's recovery. They can also learn about the nature of the disease, how treatment works and what to expect, and gain the support of other family members in the same position.</p>
<p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Aftercare<br />Alcohol treatment programs often provide aftercare support and/or referrals to ensure that patients continue to have the ongoing recovery assistance they need after returning home. For many, this step in the recovery process is one of the most significant, allowing a successful beginning in sobriety to turn into a successful future.</p>
